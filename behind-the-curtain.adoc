We've started a book ...
------------------------

* Title: Debian Package Management
* Authors: Axel Beckert and Frank Hofmann
* Start: Spring 2013
* Length: about 500 pages
* Completely written in readable German
** Intended audience: advance beginners, professionals
** An English translation is planned

Contents of the Book
--------------------

* describes the package management on dpkg/apt based systems in detail
* focusses on Debian GNU/Linux, but also fits for derivatives like Ubuntu, LinuxMint, etc.
* Part 1: Concepts -- ideas behind Package Management
* Part 2: Tools -- the programs and their possibilities
* Part 3: Best Practice -- solutions for more complex real-life situations

Status
~~~~~~

* Part 1 and 2: mostly complete
* Part 3: still things missing

Releases
--------

* The whole contents is under a free license --
  http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/[CC BY-SA 4.0]
* https://github.com/dpmb/dpmb[Source Code available at GitHub]: https://github.com/dpmb/dpmb
* From the source code you can build the following formats:
** HTML (multiple variants)
** E-book (so far PDF, EPUB and MobiPocket)
** Debian Package with PDF, HTML and EPUB.
* Built e-books for reading online or download at
  http://book.dpmb.org/ (currently via https://www.gitbook.com/book/dpmb/dpmb/details[Gitbook])
** Rendering at Gitbook has multiple non-trivial issues
* Printed book planned, publication at http://www.onyxneon.com/[Onyx Neon]

How we write our book
---------------------

* Base:
** Writing is a creative process and requires a specific mood --
   it doesn't work at the touch of a button.
** Our process is modeled after software development processes
** Using (free) tools as we need them.

* Writing at a fixed location: mostly in ZÃ¼rich and Berlin
** each author works mostly on his own
** Exchange via phone, e-mail and video conference
** occassional explicit meetings about the book
   (so-called "book sprints")

* Writing on the road
** Meeting within the scope of Linux events
** in the camper van (Axel) and on the train (Frank)
** also far off locations to find silence, and not to be distracted from
   the outside world, see http://www.dpmb.org/karte/

Sources of the Book
-------------------

* Hosting is done on the platform GitHub
** without costs for free (freely available) software
** very popular and known by many developers/readers
** provides uncomplicated coordination of external contributions
** provides a simple rendering of AsciiDoc source files

* Workflow in three steps:
** clone a local copy of the book repository: `git clone git://github.com/dpmb/dpmb.git`
** build the book locally, e.g. with `make pdf`, `make html` or `dpkg-buildpackage`
** read, comment and improve the source

Versioning
----------

* Versioning control system (VCS) that we use: Git
** free, stable and very flexible VCS
** Combination of central archive, and distributed copies kept on local machines
** distributed working without permanent need of an internet connection
** steady synchronising and merging of contents

* allows ...
** ... to temporarily work without internet
** ... being able to reconstruct who changed what, and when
** ... to revert the changes

Contributing and Feedback
-------------------------

* With GitHub account: via pull request on GitHub
.. Click on the top-right fork button on https://github.com/dpmb/dpmb
.. Make your changes and commit them to your forked GitHub repo:
*** Either clone your own GitHub-Repo locally, make your changes
    locally, commit them and push them into your forked GitHub repo.
*** Or edit the files of your forked GitHub repo directly in your web
    browser on the GitHub website.
.. Open the website of your forked GitHub repo (or reload it) and
   click on "Pull Request".
* Without GitHub account: send us your patches by e-mail
.. Create local copy of our Git repo: `git clone git://github.com/dpmb/dpmb.git`
.. Make your changes and commit them locally.
.. Export patch(es) in files with `git format-patch origin/master` and
   send the patches to mailto:buch@dpmb.org[buch@dpmb.org].

* We check the patch or pull request
** Either we accept the changes or we refuse them
** If accepted, we "merge" the pull request or apply the patch with
   `git am`.

* Synchronise your local copy (`git pull`), so that all contributors
  are in sync.

Software
--------

* locally
** Git as revision control system
** AsciiDoc as platform-independent markup language for the content
*** `asciidoc` or `asciidoctor` as primary parser
*** `a2x`, `dblatex` and `pdflatex` for generating the PDF
** Make for triggering the compilation into the output formats
** Node.js and https://www.npmjs.com/package/gitbook[Gitbook
   (installed via npm)] for debugging, if the book doesn't build on
   Gitbook.

* on the web
** GitHub for management, statistics, coordination and notifications
** https://travis-ci.org/dpmb/dpmb/builds[Travis-CI for automatically
   testing, if the book still builds after a commit], also used to
   check that pull requests don't break the book.
** Gitbook for building the online version and e-books automatically
   after each `git push`. (May change soon.)

Under Construction
------------------

* Where we're still working on:
** Finetuning part 2 -- consistent wording, keywords
** Completion of part 3 -- content improvements
** Work around issues at Gitbook

* Where we need support for:
** Best practice part (part 3) -- we cannot setup, and verify all scenarios
** Which problems did you notice with .deb packages, and which tools
   popped up? How have did you solve the situation?
