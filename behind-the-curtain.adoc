* Contents is under a free license --
  http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/[CC BY-SA 4.0]
* https://github.com/dpmb/dpmb[Source Code available at GitHub]: https://github.com/dpmb/dpmb

** Debian Package with PDF, HTML and EPUB.
* Built e-books for reading online or download at
  http://book.dpmb.org/ (currently via https://www.gitbook.com/book/dpmb/dpmb/details[Gitbook])
** Rendering at Gitbook has multiple non-trivial issues
* Printed book planned, publication at http://www.onyxneon.com/[Onyx Neon]

How the book is developed
-------------------------

* Base:
** Writing is a creative process and requires a specific mood --
   doesn't work at the touch of a button.
** Our process is modeled after software development processes
** Using (free) tools as we need them.

* Writing at a fixed location: mostly in ZÃ¼rich and Berlin
** each author works mostly on his own
** Exchange via phone, e-mail and video conference
** occassional explicit meetings about the book
   (so called "book sprints")

* Writing on the road
** Meeting within the scope of Linux events
** in the camper van (Axel) and on the train (Frank)
** also far off locations to find silence and avoiding distractions

Sources of the Book
-------------------

* Hosting on the platform GitHub
** without costs for free (freely available) Software
** very popular and known to many developers/readers
** provides uncomplicated coordination of external contributions
** provides a simple rendering of AsciiDoc source files

* Workflow in three steps:
** clone a local copy of the book repository: `git clone git://github.com/dpmb/dpmb.git`
** build the book locally, e.g. with `make pdf`, `make html` or `dpkg-buildpackage`
** read, comment and improve

Versioning
----------

* Version control system (VCS): Git
** free, stable and very flexible VCS
** Combination of central archive and distributed copies
** distributed working without permanent need of an internet connection
** steady synchronising and merging of contents

* allows ...
** ... to temporarily work without internet
** ... being able to reconstruct who changed what when
** ... to revert change

Contributing and Feedback
-------------------------

* With GitHub account: via pull request on GitHub
.. Click on the top-right fork button on https://github.com/dpmb/dpmb
.. Make your changes and commit them to your forked GitHub repo:
*** Either clone your own GitHub-Repo locally, make your changes
    locally, commit them and push them into your forked GitHub repo.
*** Or edit the files of your forked GitHub repo directly in your web
    browser on the GitHub website.
.. Open the webseite of your forked GitHub repo (or reload it) and
   click on "Pull Request".
* Without GitHub account: Send patches by e-mail
.. Create local copy of our Git repo: `git clone git://github.com/dpmb/dpmb.git`
.. Make your changes and commit them locally.
.. Export patch(es) in files with `git format-patch origin/master` and
   send the patches to mailto:buch@dpmb.org[buch@dpmb.org].

* We check the patch or pull request
** Either we accept the changes or we refuse them
** If accepted, we "merge" the pull request or apply the patch with
   `git am`.

* Synchronise your local copy (`git pull`), so that all contributors
  are in sync.

Software
--------

* locally
** Git as VCS
** Asciidoc as platfor-ndependent markup language for the contents
*** `asciidoc` or `asciidoctor` as primary parser
*** `a2x`, `dblatex` and `pdflatex` for generating the PDF
** Make for triggering the compilation into the output formats
** Node.js and https://www.npmjs.com/package/gitbook[Gitbook
   (installiert via npm)] for debugging, if the book doesn't build on
   Gitbook.

* on the web
** GitHub for management, statistics, coordination and notifications
** https://travis-ci.org/dpmb/dpmb/builds[Travis-CI for automatically
   testing, if the book still builds after a commit], also used to
   check that pull requests don't break the book.
** Gitbook for building the online version and e-books automatically
   after each `git push`. (May change soon.)

Under Construction
------------------

* Where we're still working:
** Finetuning part 2 -- consistent wording, keywords
** Completion of part 3 -- Contents
** Work around issues at Gitbook

* We we need support:
** Best Practice part (part 3) -- We can't setup all scenarios
** Which problems with .deb packages and tools popped up and how have
   they been solved.
